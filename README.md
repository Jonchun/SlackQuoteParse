# SlackQuoteParse
Parses your clipboard containing a Copied Slack chat transcript and cleans it up.

## Installation
- Download SlackQuoteParse.workflow.zip [(Link here)](https://github.com/Jonchun/SlackQuoteParse/releases/download/1.0/SlackQuoteParse.workflow.zip)
- Extract the .zip file so that you see a .workflow file.
- Double-click and install it.
- Go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services > General > SlackQuoteParse and set a hotkey. I use Ctrl+Cmd+V.

After you copy parts of a conversation from Slack, press your chosen hotkey (e.g. ctrl+cmd+v) and wait a second or two as it's not always instant. It will then paste a nicely formatted conversation so that it is not the huge default mess you get when you currently try to copy+paste conversations from Slack.
